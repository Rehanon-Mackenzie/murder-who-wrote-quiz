## About

This is a quiz for all the armchair detectives who love nothing better than sitting down with their favourite ficitional gumshoe and solving a murder from the comfort of their own living room.

Murder mysteries continue to be a universal source of pleasure for people and each generation has its own unsuspecting sleuth or amateur busy body that is able to unpick the clues and workout who dunnit? In 2020 it was the centenary celebration for the first ever murder mystery written by Dame Agatha Christie, _The Mysterious Affair at Styles_. This was the first outing for Hercule Poirot and his famous "little grey cells".

Since then there has been Jessica Fletcher, Colombo, Inspector Barnaby to name but a few. Each one has their own way of getting to the bottom of things whether it's acting confused and a little dishevelled in the case of Colombo or hiding your brilliant mind behind your knitting in the way of Miss Marples. They all solve the mystery in just the nick of time.

_Murder Who Wrote?_ gives the player an opportunity to see just how much they know about the genre.

## Design
  
  ### Colour Palette

In honour of each of the detectives included in the quiz I went for a colour that was associated with each of them.

* #222e50 is a rich navy blue which a favourite suit colour of Poirot.
* #8d99ae is a light gray which is often the colour that Miss Marple is dressed in.
* #f2c57c is a warm beige and the colour of Columbo's raincoat once it's had a good wash.
* #628b48 is a woodland green and captures the landscape of many of the locations in Midsomer Murders.
* #d00000 is a brilliant red and the colour of book that forms the iconic title sequence to each episode of Murder She Wrote.

The background for each page is #f2c57c as it provides a good contrast with the text.  The text colour is #222e50 and works well in both the primary and secondary fonts.  The quiz questions background colour is #8d99ae and it is also used for the hover feature on the heading on each page that returns you home.  Finally, #628b48 and #d00000 are used in the incorrect and correct classes to reveal to the player if they got a question right or wrong.

  ### Typography

The fonts for this site were chosen from Google Fonts and were imported using the URL method.

The fonts chosen were 'Corben' and ' Work Sans.

Corben italicised was the primary font and used for all of the headings throughout the site.  As it gave the vintage style that is often associated with murder mysteries.

![Heading font for Murder Who Wrote?](/documentation/heading%20murder%20who%20wrote%20example.png)

Work Sans was the secondary font used on the site and is the font for all the body text.  It was chosen because it was very readable and provides a crisp contrast to Corben.

## Features

### üñ•Ô∏è Features Common to All Pages

#### Favicon

* The favicon is a small image that displays in the browser tab. 
* The intention is to enhance the user experience for those who have multiple tabs open and cannot read the text in the tabs.
* The favicon is a doodle of a magnifying glass.  This was chosen because a magnifying glass is synomous with the murder mystery genre.  It's been used by fictional detectives from as far back as Sherlock Holmes in the Victorian era to more recently Chief Inspector Barnaby in modern day Midsomer.
* It was taken from the Icons8 website and is credited in the Media Section 

![Screenshot of favicon](/documentation/favicon%20example.png)

#### Title Navigation

* On every page of the site the h1 encloses an anchor link back to the home page.  This allows the player to navigate easily to the home page should they need to.
![Title navigation screenshot](/documentation/title%20nav%20feature.PNG)

* The hover pseudo class has been added so that on desktop view the title changes to the secondary colour to indicate to the player it' a clickable link.

Whilst coding the quiz I have kept in mind accessibility and ease of use for everyone.  This includes using:
