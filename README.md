## About

This is a quiz for all the armchair detectives who love nothing better than sitting down with their favourite fictional gumshoe and solving a murder from the comfort of their own living room.

Murder mysteries continue to be a universal source of pleasure for people and each generation has its own unsuspecting sleuth or amateur busy body that is able to unpick the clues and workout who dunnit? In 2020 it was the centenary celebration for the first ever murder mystery written by Dame Agatha Christie, _The Mysterious Affair at Styles_. This was the first outing for Hercule Poirot and his famous "little grey cells".

Since then there has been Jessica Fletcher, Colombo, Inspector Barnaby to name but a few. Each one has their own way of getting to the bottom of things whether it's acting confused and a little dishevelled in the case of Colombo or hiding your brilliant mind behind your knitting in the way of Miss Marple. They all solve the mystery in just the nick of time.

_Murder Who Wrote?_ gives the player an opportunity to see just how much they know about the genre.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

* I want the site to be responsive to the device I'm using.
* I want to be able to navigate the site easily.
* I want clear instructions on how I play the quiz so I have the best chance of getting a good score.

## Design
  
  ### Colour Palette

In honour of each of the detectives included in the quiz I went for a colour that was associated with each of them.

* #222e50 is a rich navy blue which a favourite suit colour of Poirot.
* #8d99ae is a light gray which is often the colour that Miss Marple is dressed in.
* #f2c57c is a warm beige and the colour of Columbo's raincoat once it's had a good wash.
* #628b48 is a woodland green and captures the landscape of many of the locations in Midsomer Murders.
* #d00000 is a brilliant red and the colour of book that forms the iconic title sequence to each episode of Murder She Wrote.

The background for each page is #f2c57c as it provides a good contrast with the text.  The text colour is #222e50 and works well in both the primary and secondary fonts.  The quiz questions background colour is #8d99ae and it is also used for the hover feature on the heading on each page that returns you home.  Finally, #628b48 and #d00000 are used in the incorrect and correct classes to reveal to the player if they got a question right or wrong.

  ### Typography

The fonts for this site were chosen from Google Fonts and were imported using the URL method.

The fonts chosen were 'Corben' and 'Work Sans'.

Corben italicised was the primary font and used for all of the headings throughout the site.  As it gave the vintage style that is often associated with murder mysteries.

![Heading font for Murder Who Wrote?](/documentation/heading%20murder%20who%20wrote%20example.png)

Work Sans was the secondary font used on the site and is the font for all the body text.  It was chosen because it was very readable and provides a crisp contrast to Corben.

  ### Wireframes

  The wireframes were designed for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

## Features

### üñ•Ô∏è Features Common to All Pages

#### Favicon

* The favicon is a small image that displays in the browser tab. 
* The intention is to enhance the user experience for those who have multiple tabs open and cannot read the text in the tabs.
* The favicon is a doodle of a magnifying glass.  This was chosen because a magnifying glass is synonymous with the murder mystery genre.  It's been used by fictional detectives from as far back as Sherlock Holmes in the Victorian era to more recently Chief Inspector Barnaby in modern day Midsomer.
* It was taken from the Icons8 website and is credited in the Media Section 

![Screenshot of favicon](/documentation/favicon%20example.png)

#### Title Navigation

* On every page of the site the h1 encloses an anchor link back to the home page.  This allows the player to navigate easily to the home page should they need to.
![Title navigation screenshot](/documentation/title%20nav%20feature.PNG)

* The hover pseudo class has been added so that on desktop view the title changes to the secondary colour to indicate to the player it' a clickable link.

### ‚ö° Future Implementations

* Enable the quiz to be played on desktop using just a keyboard.

* Enlarge the question bank to enable players to choose genres of murder mysteries to answer questions on.
* Create difficulty rating for the questions so that players can test their ability further.

## üñ±Ô∏è Accessibility

Whilst coding the quiz I have kept in mind accessibility and ease of use for everyone.  This includes using:
* Semantic HTML.
* Hover status on the navigation logo on each page.
* Using Sans Serif font for the body text.
* Choosing a contrasting colour palette that makes viewing easier.

## Testing

### üêõ Known Bugs and Fixes

Please see the separate [TESTING.md](Testing.md) file for all the tests carried out.

| Issue | Fix | Status | Learning |
|-------|-----|--------|--------- |
| Hover colour not appearing in device emulation | Confirmed only in Chrome DevTools ‚Äî works correctly on actual devices | Fixed | Learned that mobile devices don‚Äôt use hover ‚Äî test differently |
| Score not saving after refresh (early testing) | Added local storage check before saving | Fixed | Learned how to use Dev Tools  to look at the Application tab to view what is being saved in local storage
| Minor layout overlap on iPhone SE | Adjusted flex container height and padding | Fixed | Check through the results in each device when making layout changes
| Correct answer not highlighting when incorrect option clicked | Found that dataset.index instead of dataset.answerIndex had been coded. Updated selector in JS to match HTML attribute | Fixed | Be consistent with naming between HTML attributes and JS selectors |
| Quiz questions not loading randomly | JSON fetch order was static.  Added the Fisher Yates shuffle function to randomise questions | Fixed | Important to understand the different ways you can shuffle before iterating |

### Known Issues

The project is designed to be responsive from 375px and upwards, in line with the material taught on the course LMS. Minor layout inconsistencies may occur on extra-wide (e.g. 4k/8k monitors), or smart-display devices (e.g. Nest Hub, Smart Watches, Game Boy Color, etc.), as these resolutions are outside the project's scope, as taught by Code Institute.

## Credits
### Code Used
* I followed the James Quick quiz [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u98ROZjBWy8) to get an initial understanding of quiz logic as well as how to use local storage for storing high scores.
* I watched this [explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfekYmg4vCE) on the Fisher-Yates shuffle to understand how to randomise my array of questions.

### Content
* All questions for the quiz were formulated using my general knowledge and fed into [Chat GPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
* All the other content including the introduction was written by myself.

### Media

* [Icons8](https://icons8.com) provided the favicon magnifying glass.

## Acknowledgements
* Thank you to my mentor Richard  who is always really easy to talk to and explains things in a way that I understand.  
* As always massive thanks to my dearly departed Nan who got me into murder mysteries in the first place.  She ditched fairytales and instead chose to read us large print Agatha Christie novels.
* All my friends and family who took time to take the quiz and made sure everything was working and as always gave me loads of encouragement when I was doubting myself.
* Finally, to all the *wonderful queens of crime* who dominate this genre and have inspired  me to always be curious and trust my intuition.
