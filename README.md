This is a quiz for all the armchair detectives who love nothing better than sitting down with your favourite ficitional gumshoe and solving a murder from the comfort of your own living room.

Murder mysteries continue to be a universal source of pleasure for people and each generation has its own unsuspecting sleuth or amateur busy body that is able to unpick the clues and workout who dunnit?  In 2020 it was the centenary celebration for the first ever murder mystery written by Dame Agatha Christie, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*.  This was the first outing for Hercule Poirot and his famous "little grey cells".  

Since then there has Jessica Fletcher, Colombo, Inspector Barnaby to name but a few.  Each one has their own way of getting to the bottom of things whether it's acting confused and a little dishevelled in the case of Colombo or hiding your brilliant mind behind your knitting in the way of Miss Marples.  They all solve the mystery in just the nick of time.

*Murder Who Wrote?* gives the player an opportunity to see just how much they know about the genre and find out which sleuth's style most matches theirs.
